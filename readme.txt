README of Thesis_Walczynski

---------------------------

Following Github repository serves as a data storage for R code used for developing my master thesis.

Files outline:

data.R		includes code reg. connecting to twitter, downloading data, and cleaning it. 		Additionally it includes full code used for accuracy tests with Trump tweets.

autotest_C.R	includes code used for accuracy tests with Biden tweets (H5)
autotest_Z.R	includes code used for accuracy tests with Trump tweets (H3, H4)
autotest_W.R	includes code used for accuracy tests with Trump tweets (H3, H4)
autotest_U.R	includes code used for accuracy tests with Trump tweets (H3, H4)
autotest_P46.R	includes code used for accuracy tests with POTUS tweets
autotest_P44.R	includes code used for accuracy tests with POTUS44 (Obama) tweets
autotest.R	includes code used for accuracy tests with Trump tweets (H1b)
autotestBiden.R	includes code used for accuracy tests with Biden tweets (H1c)
autotestObama.R	includes code used for accuracy tests with Obama tweets (H1a)

All autotests perform same operations. Difference being in dataframes's names and timelines
Such division was meant to ease working on data at a later stage.

Best wishes recreating my findings,
Kind Regards,
